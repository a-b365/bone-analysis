PROJECT DESCRIPTION: Medical Image Processing for Knee CT Scan Analysis

OVERVIEW:
This project implements comprehensive image processing techniques for analyzing knee region CT scans, focusing on femur and tibia bone segmentation, contour manipulation, and anatomical landmark detection.

RESULTS FOLDER CONTENTS:
- 6 .nii files containing processed medical imaging data
- Original segmentation mask (including femur and tibia separated) 
  filenames = ["3702_left_knee_mask_final.nii.gz", "3702_left_knee_mask_segmented.nii.gz"]
- Expanded masks: 2mm and 4mm expansion variants
  filenames = ["3702_left_knee_expanded_mask_1.nii.gz", "3702_left_knee_expanded_mask_2.nii.gz"]
- Randomized masks: 20% and 80% randomness levels
  filenames = ["3702_left_knee_randomized_mask_1.nii.gz", "3702_left_knee_randomized_mask_2.nii.gz"]
- All masks preserve original metadata for clinical compatibility

COORDINATE DATA:
- coordinates.txt: Contains medial and lateral landmark coordinates
- Structured format with proper headers for result verification
- Enables accuracy assessment of landmark detection techniques

VISUALIZATION OUTPUTS:
- images/ folder: Isometric view renderings of all masks in PNG format
- Interactive 3D visualizations available through provided functions
- Landmark images can be generated using integrated viewing functions

TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
- utils/ folder: Four specialized modules for core functionality
  1. Mask creation and interactive 3D segmentation viewing
  2. Contour expansion, randomization, and visualization
  3. Landmark detection with medial/lateral point identification
  4. Comprehensive plotting functions for distance maps, contours, masks, and segments

INTERACTIVE DEVELOPMENT:
- notebooks/ folder: Jupyter notebook with detailed implementation examples
- Visual interactive environment for rapid prototyping
- Comprehensive dataset visualizations and processing demonstrations
- Quick-start scripts for immediate experimentation

SETUP REQUIREMENTS:
- PowerShell script execution required for initial setup
- requirements.txt provides complete package dependencies with versions
- All necessary libraries must be installed before project execution

CORE TECHNOLOGIES:
- scikit-image, scipy, opencv for image processing
- matplotlib and mayavi for 2D/3D visualization
- Medical imaging format support (.nii files)
- Cross-platform compatibility

APPLICATION DOMAINS:
- Medical image analysis and research
- Surgical planning and preoperative assessment
- Anatomical morphology studies
- Clinical decision support systems
